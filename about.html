                <h1>WELCOME TO CODE4CT</h1>
                <p>Code for Cape Town (Code4CT) is a programme that introduces young girls to basic web building skills and exposes them to opportunities in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector. Participants are trained in web development, design principles, as well as courses in professional development. Code4CT aims to inspire a generation of young girls who are well-prepared with a toolkit of technical and soft skills in order to achieve high impact in the workplace .
                These are skills that everyone should have. Even if you have no intention of becoming a professional coder, you will benefit from knowing how to think in this way in this increasingly computerized economy. A growing number of permanent job positions that use information technology to deliver a product or a service are becoming available in the local economy. It is estimated that nearly 75000 such jobs will come online in South Africa within the next five years. These digital jobs will mostly be driven by the ICT, Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), and the financial services industries. These are the fastest growing sectors in our economy. They are also the sectors that have the highest demand for entry-level digital skills.

                <h1>Who We Are</h1>
                <p>Code for Cape Town strives to see young women empowered to leverage technology for social innovation, so that there is greater diversity in the African tech industry.  Code for Cape Town equips high potential female learners with the coding, problem solving and life skills that will allow them to leverage technology to contribute meaningfully to South Africa’s innovation system.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                <p>Code4ct exists to see young South African women in positions to drive African innovation</p>
                
                <h3>Our Values</h3>
                <p>The following values guide the way in which Code for Cape Town operates:
 
                        Our first responsibility is to ensure every learner in our program feels challenged and supported in her learning; that each learner realises her potential to manifest change.
                        To do that, we are committed to a culture of innovation and excellence. We value collaboration and openness.
                        We believe in the strength of the collective: one person’s success is everyone’s joy; one person’s failure requires everyone’s support.
                        We value holistic wellness with the understanding that if each individual seeks mental and physical well-being this results in the optimal functioning of the collective.
                        We believe each learner has the potential to be responsible and respectful. We will not tolerate a failure to accept responsibility nor a lack of respect for others.
                        We are committed to an equitable society and creating a racially and culturally diverse learning environment.  We will work to dismantle euro-centric education and structural inequities within our society.</p>
